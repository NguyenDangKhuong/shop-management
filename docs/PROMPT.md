## 🎬 Veo3 Video Prompt Templates

### Reference Images

Mỗi prompt `describe` sử dụng 2 reference images (đặt ở **AutoFlow**, không phải ở Prompt):

| Ref | Nội dung | ImageUsageType | Mục đích |
|-----|----------|----------------|----------|
| **Image 1** | PNG bộ đồ (product photo, không có người) | `IMAGE_USAGE_TYPE_ASSET` | Mẫu sẽ mặc chính xác bộ đồ này |
| **Image 2** | Hình mẫu (người mẫu đã tạo) | `IMAGE_USAGE_TYPE_ASSET` | Giữ khuôn mặt/dáng người này |

### Prompt 1 — Mirror selfie che mặt

> A highly detailed cinematic video of the fashion model shown in reference image 2. CRITICAL RULE — The outfit MUST match reference image 1 exactly in length and coverage. If the top in the reference covers the belly then the video outfit MUST also fully cover the belly and midsection at all times with ZERO skin showing between the top hem and the waistband. NEVER crop shorten or raise the top. NEVER expose the navel or midriff unless the reference image explicitly shows it. This is the highest priority instruction. She must be wearing the identical outfit from reference image 1 preserving every detail including exact color exact pattern exact prints exact fabric texture exact neckline exact sleeve length exact hem length exact pants or skirt length exact fit exact silhouette and all decorative details such as bows ribbons ties buttons lace trim embroidery belts and any accessories as shown in the product photo. Do not alter modify or reinterpret any part of the clothing. She has luminous snow-white porcelain skin, Douyin goddess aesthetic, long silky black hair with soft natural waves, wearing stylish feminine thin gold-framed round glasses. She has a slender figure with extremely long slender legs. The model has exactly two arms and two hands at all times — strict anatomical consistency, no extra limbs or duplicate body parts. She is standing [POSE] in front of a full-length mirror in a [BACKGROUND]. Soft golden morning sunlight streaming through sheer white curtains creating warm natural light and gentle shadows. All movements are slow gentle and deliberate — no sudden fast motions. She is holding an orange iPhone 17 Pro Max up in front of her face covering her face completely while recording a mirror selfie video so only the phone and her body outfit are visible not her face. The phone camera angle moves naturally closer to show the outfit fabric texture and details then slowly pulls back to reveal her full body silhouette and long legs like a real person filming themselves. She speaks naturally in Vietnamese describing the outfit she is wearing with a warm friendly tone like a real KOL selling fashion on livestream. No text no captions no animals. Ultra-realistic natural handheld phone movement. Shallow depth of field with model in sharp focus. Fashion editorial cinematic color grading

She pinches the fabric slightly between her fingers highlighting the softness and drape of the material. She speaks naturally in Vietnamese without greeting or saying hello just directly describing the fabric quality and how the outfit fits her body with a confident casual tone. No text no captions no animals. Ultra-realistic natural handheld phone movement. Shallow depth of field. Fashion editorial cinematic color grading

She speaks naturally in Vietnamese without greeting or saying hello just casually commenting on the outfit details and how it looks from different angles with a sweet relaxed voice.

### Design Notes

> [!CAUTION]
> **Outfit coverage (HIGHEST PRIORITY)** — Đặt `CRITICAL RULE` ngay **dòng thứ 2** của prompt, trước cả mô tả ngoại hình. Dùng từ mạnh: `MUST`, `NEVER`, `ZERO skin`, `highest priority instruction`. Đây là thay đổi quan trọng nhất để AI không tự ý hở bụng.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Outfit fidelity** — Dùng `OUTFIT_DETAILS` ngay sau `OUTFIT_COVERAGE` để AI giữ nguyên 100% bộ đồ: color, pattern, fabric, neckline, sleeve, hem, fit, silhouette.

> [!WARNING]
> **Body shape** — Dùng `"slender figure"` thay vì `"hourglass figure"` để AI không ép eo quá mức gây hở bụng.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Body integrity** — Luôn thêm `"The model has exactly two arms and two hands at all times — strict anatomical consistency, no extra limbs or duplicate body parts"` ngay sau mô tả ngoại hình.

> [!WARNING]
> **Slow motion pacing** — Luôn thêm `"All movements are slow gentle and deliberate — no sudden fast motions"` trước đoạn mô tả hành động.

> [!NOTE]
> - Tất cả 3 prompts đều **che mặt hoàn toàn** bằng điện thoại + có thoại tiếng Việt
> - Không dùng `"no talking"` / `"no speaking"` / `"does not speak"` / `"no dialogue"` → gây lỗi `PUBLIC_ERROR_AUDIO_FILTERED`
> - Dùng placeholder `[POSE]` + `[BACKGROUND]` → Sub Prompt tự random mỗi lần gọi
