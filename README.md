## 🪝 Git Hooks

This project uses Git hooks to ensure code quality before pushing.

### Automatic Setup

Git hooks are **automatically installed** when you run:

```bash
npm install
```

The `postinstall` script sets up the pre-push hook from `.githooks/` folder.

### Pre-Push Checks

Before every `git push`, the following checks run automatically:

1. ✅ **ESLint** - Code style and quality
2. ✅ **Jest Tests** - All unit tests (26 tests)
3. ✅ **Production Build** - Verifies build succeeds

**Example output:**
```
🔍 Running pre-push checks...
📝 Running linter...
✔ No ESLint warnings or errors
🧪 Running tests...
Tests: 26 passed, 26 total
🏗️  Checking build...
✓ Compiled successfully
✅ All checks passed! Pushing to remote...
```

### Bypassing Checks

In rare cases, you can skip checks:

```bash
git push --no-verify
```

⚠️ **Warning:** Only use when absolutely necessary!

### Troubleshooting

**Problem:** `npm: command not found` when pushing from VS Code/GUI

**Solution:** Hooks are already configured with correct PATH. If issue persists:

```bash
npm run postinstall
```

**More info:** See [.githooks/README.md](./.githooks/README.md)
